# SOC-Modeling-Data-Preparation-and-Optimization
SOC change (2009â€“2018) was calculated, data cleaned, categorical variables one-hot encoded, and stored in a CSV. A Random Forest model was trained, and GridSearchCV optimized hyperparameters. 5-fold cross-validation determined the best parameters, improving model accuracy.
